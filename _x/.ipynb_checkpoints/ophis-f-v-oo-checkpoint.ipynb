    "### Poor isomorphism between Chroma and Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Or really, no explicit isomorphism at all. And this is a problem because these are really *the same thing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had implemented the `Interval` class, and written all the logic for how intervals are inverted, augmented, and diminished. This requires understanding of the interplay between interval distances (third, fourth, sixth) and their qualities (Major, minor, Perfect), and how many half-steps each are. And of course there's that zero-indexing stuff to think about (second = 1, third = 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I implemented the `Chroma` class, and wrote almost the same logic (but just a bit different) for how pitches are augmented and diminished (pitches aren't inverted). This requires an understanding of the interplay between note letter names (C, D, E), how those letter names map to a zero-indexed numerical representation (C = 0, D = 1, E = 2), and how modifiers like *sharp* and *flat* affect the total number of halfsteps from C (the origin point in modern music theory). \n",
    "\n",
    "But these are, as I said, *exactly the same thing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every note can be represented as an interval from C. And not only can it be represented that way, but that is exactly how it was already defined. There is no other reasonable way to (numerically) define notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example in case this isn't clear:\n",
    "\n",
    " - *E Natural* is a Major Third away from *C*. \n",
    " - In our zero-indexed representation intervals, a Third is `2`.\n",
    " - A Major Third is `4` half-steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those two numbers, `(2, 4)`, are an integral part of the definition of *E Natural*; without them, you can't do any of the manipulation that makes the `Chroma` meaningful."

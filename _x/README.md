/_x readme

The /_x directory is a place for experiments and nonsense, mostly using Jupyter notebooks. Nothing here is directly relevant to a distribution of the code, but is preserved in the /_x directory for convenience to myself and anyone else who might want to play around with something. This is meant to encourage open experimentation.
